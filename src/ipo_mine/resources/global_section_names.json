allows the advancement of  costs  of  defending  against  litigation;  and permits companies incorporated in illinois to purchase insurance on behalf of directors, officers, employees and agents against liabilities  whether  or  not  in  the  circumstances such companies would have the power to indemnify  against  such liabilities under the provisions of the statute. the  company's  articles,  incorporated by reference as exhibit 3.1, and its bylaws, incorporated  by  reference as exhibit  3.2, provide for indemnification of its  officers and directors  to the full extent permitted by the illinois business corporation  act.   the  articles  of  the company eliminate, to the fullest extent permitted by illinois law, liability of a director to the company or its stockholders for   monetary  damages  for  breach  of  such  director's fiduciary  duty  of  care  except  for  liability  where  a director  (a)  breaches  his or her duty of loyalty to the company or its stockholders, (b) fails to act in good faith or engages in intentional misconduct  or  knowing violation of law, (c) authorizes payment of an illegal  dividend  or stock  repurchase  or  (d)  obtains  an  improper  personal benefit.   while  liability  for monetary damages has been eliminated, equitable remedies,  such  as injunctive relief or recision remain available.  in addition,  a  director is not relieved of his responsibilities under any other  law, including the federal securities laws. the  company will enter into indemnification agreements in the form  described  below  with  each  person  who  is currently  a  member  of  its  board  of directors and with persons who in the future become directors  of the company. such indemnification agreements provide for indemnification against any and all expenses incurred in connection  with, as well as any and all judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement  resulting  from,  any  threatened,  pending  or completed  action,  suit  or  proceeding,  whether  civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (collectively  an \"action\"),  by reason of the fact that such director is or was a director,  officer, employee or agent of the company, or is or was serving  at  the  request  of the company as a director,   officer,   employee   or   agent  of  another corporation,  partnership, joint venture, trust  or  other enterprise.  the indemnification agreements provide that if any payment, advance  or  indemnification  of  the director requires that he or she acted in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be for or not opposed  to the best interest of the company or without reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful, then it shall  be presumed that he or she so acted unless proven otherwise by clear   and   convincing  evidence.   the  indemnification agreements  also   provide  for  the  advancement  of  all expenses, including reasonable  attorneys'  fees,  arising from  the  investigation  of any claim, preparation for the defense or settlement of an  action.   the  indemnification agreements  authorize  the company to participate  in  the defense of any action and  to  assume  the defense thereof, with counsel who shall be reasonably satisfactory  to  the director,  provided  that the director shall be entitled to separate counsel of his  or  her  choosing  if  he  or  she reasonably  believes  that  (i)  there  exist  conflicting interests  between  himself or herself and the company  or other party (the defense  of  whom  the  company shall have assumed) or (ii) there is any substantial  likelihood  that the  company  will  be  financially  or  legally unable to satisfy   its   obligations   under  the  indemnification agreements.  the indemnification  agreements provide that a director's rights under such contract  are not exclusive of any other indemnification rights he or she  may  have under any  provision  of  law,  the  articles  or  bylaws of the company,  the  vote  of  the  company's  stockholders   or disinterested  directors,  other  agreements or otherwise. (insofar as indemnification by the company  for liabilities arising under the securities act of 1933, as  amended  (the \"securities  act\") may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling  persons  of  the  company  pursuant to the foregoing  provisions,  the company has been advised  that such indemnification is considered  by the commission to be against public policy and therefore unenforceable.) item 15.  recent sales of unregistered securities there were no transactions by the company  during  the last three years involving sales of the company's securities. item 16.  exhibits and financial statement schedules (a)  exhibits *1.1     form of subscription agreement *1.2      form of escrow agreement *3.1      amended and restated articles of incorporation of super wash, inc. *3.2      amended and restated bylaws of super wash, inc. *4      specimen common stock certificate of super wash, inc. *5.1      opinion of rudnick & wolfe *10.1      form of director indemnification agreement *10.2      form of operations agreement *10.3      form of tax indemnification agreement **23.1      consent of arthur andersen llp *23.3      consent of rudnick & wolfe (included in exhibit 5.1 hereof) **24      power of attorney **27      financial data schedule *99.1      consents of persons named to become directors *   to be filed by amendment **  filed with this document }   previously filed (b)  financial statement schedule item 17.  undertakings insofar  as  indemnification  for  liabilities  arising under the act, may be permitted to directors, officers, and controlling  persons  of  the  registrant  pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the securities  and exchange commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is, therefore, unenforceable.   in the  event  that  a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than  the  payment  by the registrant of expenses  incurred  or  paid  by  a director,  officer  or controlling  person of the registrant  in  the  successful defense of any election, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,  officer or controlling person in connection with the securities  being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion  of  its  counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent,  submit  to  a  court  of appropriate   jurisdiction   the  question  whether  such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the act and will be governed  by  the final adjudication of such issue. the undersigned registrant hereby undertakes: ()   to  file,  during any period in  which  offers  or sales are being made,  a  post-effective  amendment to this registration statement: <page> ()   to include any prospectus required by section 10(a)(3) of the securities act of 1933; ()   to  reflect in the prospectus  any  facts  or events  arising   after   the  effective  date  of  the registration  statement  (or   the  most  recent  post- effective amendment thereof) which,  individually or in the aggregate, represent a fundamental  change  in  the information  set  forth  in the registration statement. notwithstanding the foregoing, any increase or decrease in volume of securities offered  (if  the  total dollar value of securities offered would not exceed that which was registered) and any deviation from the low  or high and  of  the  estimated  maximum  offering range may be reflected  in  the form of prospectus  filed  with  the commission  pursuant   to   rule   424(b)  if,  in  the aggregate, the changes in volume and price represent no more  than",

information index to financial statements prospectus summary the  following summary is qualified  in its entirety by the more detailed information included   elsewhere  in   this   prospectus. unless  the  context otherwise requires,  all references   in   this  prospectus   to   the \"company\"   shall  mean  specialized   health products   international,   inc.,   and   its subsidiaries  on  a consolidated  basis  and, where  the context so requires, shall include its predecessors. the company the  company primarily develops  health care  products that limit or prevent the risk of  accidental needle sticks which may  cause the  spread of blood-borne diseases  such  as hiv and hepatitis b, and secondarily develops other  products  for use in the  health  care industry.  the company intends to principally use  third parties to manufacture, market and distribute its products. the company has created a portfolio  of proprietary, safety health care products that are  in  various  stages of production,  pre- production,  development and  research.   the company  is presently developing  a  line  of products  using  the company's  extresafe(tm) medical needle technology (the \"extresafe(tm) products\"),  which incorporates a  system  to allow    a   contaminated   needle   to    be automatically   retracted   and   immediately encapsulated without exposure to  the  health care  worker.   the technology  retracts  the inserted  needle into a safe housing  quickly and  automatically, minimizing the chance  of an  inadvertent  stick by a  \"dirty\"  needle. retraction   is   initiated   by   a   simple depression   of   a  designated   distortable portion of the housing assuring that there is no  action directed toward or away  from  the patient  which  might  affect  the  depth  of needle penetration. the company's extresafe(tm) products are aimed  at addressing the growing concerns  of health    care   institutions   and   workers concerning the spread of infectious  diseases caused  by  the estimated 800,000  accidental needle sticks that occur each year.  products under   development  that   incorporate   the extresafe(tm)   medical   needle   technology include  the extresafe(tm) phlebotomy device, extresafe(tm) catheter and several  different extresafe(tm)   syringe  applications.    the company   expects  to  introduce   additional products using this technology. prototypes of the  first  product  using the  extresafe(tm) medical  needle technology were completed  in april,  1995  and  commercial  production  is anticipated to commence in 1997, provided the necessary  fda  approvals  are  obtained,  of which  there is no assurance.  prototypes  of the  extresafe(tm) catheter and extresafe(tm) syringe were completed in the second half  of 1995.  the  company's concepts for  a  safety intravenous  flow gauge and blood  collection device are in the research stage. the  company  is  developing  a  safety lancet (the \"safetystrip(tm)\"), a small hand- held  device  for  penetrating  the  skin  to obtain  blood  for analysis.   the  company's safetystrip(tm) lancet is designed to provide protection   from  accidental   exposure   to infectious   blood   borne   diseases.    the safetystripo   lancets will  be  provided  in cartridge  strip housings of six lancets  per strip,   a   configuration  that  is   patent protected.  the strip housing is loaded  into a convenient low-cost hand held carrier which also   provides  a  means  for   safely   and conveniently  triggering each lancet.   after penetrating the skin, the safetystripo  blade automatically returns inside its housing  and cannot be reused.  the used blade, encased by its  protective housing, is then  broken  off from  the  cartridge strip and  appropriately discarded.   a  prototype of the safetystripo lancet  was completed in 1996 and the company anticipates  that commercial production  will begin in 1996. the  company's earliest safety  product line is its safety cradle(r) sharps container products  designed  to  reduce  the  risk  of accidental  needle  sticks  and  exposure  to contaminated  instruments when  disposing  of contaminated    \"sharps\"   (i.e.,    needles, syringes,    blood    collection     systems, intravenous   catheters,   surgical   blades, lancets,   etc.).    the   safety   cradle(r) products  allow for disposal of sharps  in  a container  that incorporates a  self  closing sharps   containment  flap,   open/close/lock mechanism.    the  safety  cradle(r)   sharps containers  are  specifically  designed   for alternate site use and to provide convenience and  safety  for  portable applications.   in december  1994,  the company  introduced  the first  in its line of safety cradle(r) sharps containers and additional sizes and  versions of  the containers were released in the third and fourth quarters of 1995. at commencement of this offering, there will  be outstanding (a) 8,589,153 shares  of common  stock, of which 8,289,153  shares  of common stock are being registered hereby  and 294,872   shares   of   common   stock    are effectively  free

the sale of a substantial  part  of these  securities could adversely affect  the market  price of the common stock, which  may hinder  any future efforts of the company  to raise capital.  see

products; the  company  may  be unable  to  effectively compete   with   manufacturers   of   similar products; the company may find itself  unable to  compete  with  other manufacturers  as  a result

protection for some  of the   company's   products,   the   company's possible inability to raise additional  funds if   need  develops  for  such  funding;  the company's   possible  inability   to   obtain approval  of the united states food and  drug administration (\"fda\") for some or all of its products  which  require such  approval;  the value of the company's stock will decrease as a  result  of  the registration and  sale  of additional   outstanding   shares   of    the company's  common  stock.   in  addition,  an investment  in the securities offered  hereby involves  risks that: certain  provisions  of applicable   law,  and  certain  contractual, charter  and bylaw provisions of the company, will have the effect of limiting officer  and director  liability and will

companies in volatile industries, such as the company.     prospective   investors   should carefully  read  and  consider  the   matters discussed under \"risk factors\" prior  to  any investment

(delta),  spirit airlines  (spirit),  and other airlines that currently  provide service from the orlando  international  airport  to these  markets.  the  company  may also face competition  from new airlines  providing  service to these markets and existing airlines  increasing  service and/or lowering  fares.  there can be no assurance that any of these actions by other  competitors  would not adversely  affect the company's ability to maintain adequate load factors. practices of unfair,  exclusionary  competition.  while the  department  of transportation is proposing rules to eliminate such exclusionary conduct engaged in by other  markets,  major air carriers have  attempted to exclude new entrant air  carriers  through a number of  tactics  including  drastic  price  cuts and flooding the market with new low-fare  capacity.  there can be no assurance that these  proposed  rules will be  adopted  and that a large air  carrier  will not exercise these predatory  actions to unfairly compete against the company.  this could adversely affect the company's business plan the  company's  strategy  not to  offer  any  frequent  flyer  programs  or participate in any of the established  computerized  reservation  systems (crs), used  extensively by other airlines and travel agents could become a competitive disadvantage. see business - competition and industry considerations. other  airlines  may offer fares  equal to those  offered by the company or introduce new non-stop service between cities served by the company's flights to prevent the company from attaining a share of the passenger traffic necessary to maintain profitable operations.  the company's ability to meet price competition depends  on its  ability  to  operate  at  costs  equal  to or  lower  than  its competitors  or potential  competitors.  in addition,  competitors  with greater financial  resources than the company may attempt to price their fares below the company's fares and/or increase their service,  which could adversely affect the company's profitability. see business - competition and industry considerations.

      "the  airline  deregulation  act of 1978 (the  \"deregulation  act\") made the airline  industry  highly  competitive.   it  substantially  reduced  government regulation of domestic routes and fares,  and increased the airlines  ability to compete with respect to fares, destinations, and flight frequency's. most major airlines today have complex hub systems,  with several different type and sizes of aircraft and partner with commuter airlines to feed passengers to their  hubs and code share  ticketing  to the final  destinations.  the major airlines  smaller jet aircraft  usually  serve  secondary  cities with  commuter aircraft  (usually  nineteen  passenger)  serve the  smaller  cities  and towns. flights between the hub and small towns,  small cities and secondary  cities are usually  operated on higher  frequencies to coordinate  service with  connecting flights to and from the hub to other  destinations  and hubs. this system allows airlines to serve more destinations, (some of which would not otherwise have air service)  capture a greater share of the passenger  market,  and produce greater revenues. most major hub cities are dominated by a single large carrier, such as delta air lines in atlanta. hub  systems  are  complex  and  inherently  require  flights  that are not profitable to meet scheduling  requirements.  these flights may be scheduled for inconvenient  times,  or use an  aircraft  which  has a  greater  capacity  than required for the flight.  these flights  increase  operating costs which must be offset by the  flights  with high load  factors  and  profits.  in an attempt to increase  load factors on these  flights,  airlines  operating  hub systems have contrived  restrictive,  conditional  and  complicated  fares.  low fare tickets encourage  airline use for flights with low load factors.  additionally,  having multiple  classes of service,  such as first class,  business  class,  and coach creates  a  complex   reservations  system  that  can  be  very  frustrating  to passengers. airlines  that do not operate a hub system such as southwest  airlines have various operating strategies, most operate a \"direct flight\" system with usually one class of minimal  service,  no frills,  and  aircraft  configured  with high density  seating.  these  airlines  usually  avoid  highly  serviced  routes and generally choose routes that fill a niche market. to  operate  a  profitable  low fare  airline,  high load  factors  and low operating costs must be maintained.  marketing substantially lower fares, direct and consistent  service can be very effective in maintaining  high load factors. most low fare carriers,  large and small, are very cost effective by focusing on managing the airline,  and  outsourcing  or contracting a majority of operations and services. melbourne  international  airport is  presently  serviced by two  airlines, delta air  lines,  a major air  carrier  that  operates  a hub system and spirit airlines,  a small low fare air carrier.  delta air lines provides several daily flights to atlanta  their major hub and flights  from  atlanta to the  company's planned  destinations.  spirit provides two daily non-stop flights to new york's laguardia airport. initially the company does not plan to provide service to the new york laguardia airport,  but does plan to provide non-stop service to one of new york's key  airports.  there can be no  assurance  delta,  spirit,  or other airlines will not provide additional service to melbourne international airport. company strategy the  company's  strategy is to focus on the  business  traveler who usually does not have the luxury to book  flights  well in advance or to comply with the highly restrictive  conditions of low priced tickets.  because of this, business travelers  are usually  forced to purchase a high priced full fare coach  ticket which  offers a low level of service,  or an  extremely  high priced first class ticket that offers  excellent  service.  some  airlines on some flights  offer a limited number of \"business class\" seats that provide more  comfortable  seating and a higher  level of service  than coach.  this is a desirable  choice for the business traveler, but often unavailable. the company believes by developing a very low cost highly efficient airline it will be able to offer its passengers excellent service at a reasonable price, while  producing  substantial  profits.  the company  plans to have a \"no games\" relationship  with its customers  offering full fare \"one price per destination\" tickets that will  approximate  the advanced  restricted  \"coach\" fares of major airlines.  management  wants  cardinal  airlines to be  recognized  as a company dedicated to safety,  that provides a high level of service and has a \"no games\" relationship with it's customers. management  believes  that by  offering  the  highest  levels of safety and customer  service,  as well as non-stop flights to key destinations load factors would be maximized.  the company will offer only one class of service which will be equivalent to first class service offered by other airlines. the company will configure its aircraft with large \"first class seats\" and specialized galleys to facilitate  serving excellent meals with  complimentary  champagne and wine. the company  will offer a full fare  ticket  (one price per  destination)  that will approximate the advanced restricted \"coach\" fares of major airlines. management  recognizes the value of its  employees.  the company will place special importance on the selection of new employees.  management  believes,  by hiring qualified employees, with a structured employment program that allows for career  advancement and job security;  and providing proper training,  necessary resources, and a safe pleasant work environment, that it will be able to develop and maintain a highly  productive  workforce.  the company  intends to develop a \"cafeteria style\" employee benefits program, that would add significant valuable benefits to the  employees,  and meet  individual  needs  without  hindering the company's  ability to maintain profit levels.  this may include programs such as excellent employee child care,  insurance,  retirement benefits,  stock options, and  company  sponsored  clubs and  organizations.  the  company  believes  such employee programs will promote loyalty and productivity. the company  believes that a simplified  corporate  structure  with limited tier levels will promote excellent communications and interaction throughout the entire   workforce,   allowing  the  company  to  benefit  from  its  employees' experience. the company has identified a mature,  fully  integrated,  automated,  \"turn key\" airline  software system which provides for complete  airline  capabilities and functions.  the identified system is year 2000 compliant.  this is a unified system that operates on readily available \"generic\" ibm compatible computers, is designed  to  provide  for  growth  and  expansion,  and is  simple to learn and operate.  this system covers the entire spectrum of airline operations including customer services, flight operations, ground operations,  maintenance, inventory control,   and  communications.   as  an  example,  it  provides  for  automated reservations  and  ticketing,  with  connectivity  to travel  agents  and remote operating sites. the company believes that its ability to begin operations using a simple,  reliable,  unified system will provide significant cost savings and a competitive edge over other airlines using more  complicated  systems which have evolved over a period of years. the company will  \"outsource\"  services where it is more cost effective or productive. geographic market the company,  based in melbourne florida, will initially provide service to large key markets in the eastern united states.  service between these prominent markets and central florida historically  provides some of the highest passenger and fare yields.  management  believes that melbourne  international  airport is strategically  located to  capitalize  on the  significant  business  markets of central  florida,  with an additional  advantage of the close  proximity to many notable  tourist  attractions,  such as kennedy  space center,  port  canaveral, beaches, and major orlando theme parks. fares, route system, and scheduling the company  will offer a simple full fare,  one class open ticket  without restrictive  conditions  (such as advance  booking and saturday night stay over) and a single price per destination. initially, all flights will be non-stop. the company  plans to commence  flight  operations  with  non-stop  service  between melbourne international airport and baltimore washington  international airport, then add service to the new york market. the company has begun negotiations with baltimore's  washington   international  airport  and  believes  that  gate  and maintenance  areas can be  leased on  favorable  terms.  one of the most  common mistakes  by  new  carriers  is  uncontrolled  growth.   maintaining  a  steady, controlled  growth,  the company would add additional service to other prominent markets  throughout  the eastern  united  states.  flights  will be scheduled to provide significant and convenient service to these markets. marketing the company plans to add additional  safety equipment to its aircraft which exceeds the mandated  requirements  of the faa, such as fire and smoke detection in all cargo and baggage  compartments,  and  equipment  designed for the flight crew to deal with smoke in the aircraft's cockpit.  flight crews will be trained in the proper use of certain  emergency  medical  equipment  that will be on all company aircraft. management believes the company's planned configuration of the aircraft with fewer, more comfortable seats, is also inherently safer. the company  plans to  maximize  the  effectiveness  of its  marketing  by: concentrating on passenger  potential areas surrounding  destinations  served by the company.  the company will use local cost effective  media such as newspaper advertisements,  radio advertisements  during the morning and afternoon commuter rush  hours,  and  billboards  on  prominent  highways  in  melbourne,  florida. additionally,  by direct contact and promotions to area  businesses,  clubs, and governmental   agencies,   the  company  will   nurture  a  \"preferred   airline relationship.\" management believes,  visibility and recognition are extremely important in marketing,  especially for a new airline.  the company  believes by painting its aircraft a vivid  cardinal red color they will be highly  visible  parked at the gate,  taxiing,  and in flight.  the company's bright red aircraft will actually act as a logo, and be identified even from a distance. the  ease  of  making  reservations  and  ticketing  is a  crucial  part of capturing the largest  possible market share.  the company believes an efficient and reliable automated reservations system (such as the software selected by the company),  with  connectivity  to travel  agents and the internet  will increase initial and repeat use of the  company's  airline  services.  all  reservations, counter, and gate positions will be adequately staffed with competent, friendly, and  courteous  personnel,  programs  will be developed  with travel agents that provides  incentives  to  book  customers  with  cardinal  airlines.  management believes  customers  should  have as many  viable  means of  booking a flight as possible  such as a national toll free number,  the internet and travel  agents. the company will attempt to make  purchasing a ticket as convenient and customer friendly  as  possible as this is an  important  part of the travel  experience. complete customer satisfaction will be a company objective. the company believes this can equate to the most effective advertising, \"word of mouth.\" aircraft acquisition management believes, to be cost effective,  the company should only operate one type of aircraft.  the company  believes that operating one type of aircraft will  significantly  lower  maintenance and crew training costs. the company has identified   sources,   general   availability,   and  average  cost  to  lease, lease/purchase  md-80 series aircraft.  the company believes that",

dates on which the  company  anticipates commencing operations. with respect to such dates, the company's management team has made certain assumptions  regarding,  among other things, the successful and timely completion of the offering,  the approval of its faa  certification,  the availability of adequate funding,  the absence of delays in acquiring  necessary equipment,  and the  availability  of airport space  available in an appropriate destination.   the  company's  ability  to  commence  operations  on  the  dates anticipated is subject to certain  risks,  including the risks  discussed  under \"risk  factors.\".  actual  airline  activities may vary  significantly  from the current plans depending on numerous  factors  including  changes in the costs of such activities from current  estimates,  the timing of regulatory  submissions, the status of competitive services and the status of the economy in general. all of the above  estimates  are based on the current  expectations  of the company's  management team, which may change in the future due to a large number of potential events, including unanticipated future developments. management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following  discussion and analysis  should be read in conjunction  with the financial  statements  and the related notes thereto  included  elsewhere in this  prospectus.  this prospectus  contains  forward-looking  statements  which involve  risks and  uncertainties.  the  company's  actual  results  may  differ significantly  from the results  discussed  in the  forward-looking  statements. factors  that might  cause such a  difference  include,  but are not limited to, those discussed in \"risk factors\" and in \"special note regarding forward-looking statements.\" overview the  company  is a  development  stage,  airline  company.  the  company is considered to be in the development  stage because it is devoting  substantially all of its  efforts  to  establishing  its  business  and  because  its  planned principal operations have not commenced. since its  inception  in  february  of 1997,  the  company's  efforts  have principally  been devoted to organization  and development and raising  capital. the company has not  received any revenues  from flight  services,  and does not expect any of its flights to be  commercially  available until 800,000 units are sold.  from  inception  through  december  31, 1998,  the company has  sustained cumulative  losses  of  $80,769.  these  losses  have  resulted  primarily  from expenditures incurred in connection with general and administrative  activities, organization and development, trademark registration and offering costs. the company expects to continue to incur substantial  organizational  costs in the future resulting from the purchase of aircraft and fuel,  agreements with baggage  handlers and airports as well as aircraft  maintenance,  and  marketing expenses.  accordingly, the company expects to incur increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. there can be no assurance that the company will ever achieve profitable operations. to date,  the company has not  marketed,  or  generated  revenues  from the commercialization of, any service. the company's current planned flights are not expected to be commercially  available  until the successful  completion of this offering. the company has only a limited  operating  history upon which an evaluation of the  company  and  its  prospects  can be  based.  the  risks,  expenses  and difficulties  encountered by companies at an early stage of development  must be considered when evaluating the company's prospects.  to address these risks, the company must, among other things,  successfully  develop and  commercialize  its services,  secure all  necessary  proprietary  rights,  respond  to  competitive developments  and  continued  government  regulation,  and  continue to attract, retain  and  motivate  qualified  persons.  there can be no  assurance  that the company will be successful in addressing these risks. see \"risk factors.\" the  operating  expenses  of the company  will  depend on several  factors, including the level of aircraft maintenance and repair expenses.  development of the  company's  planned  flights will depend upon  economic  factors,  which the company  cannot  predict.  management  may in some cases be able to control  the timing of  development  expenses in part by controlling  growth.  as a result of these factors,  the company  believes that  period-to-period  comparisons in the future  are not  necessarily  meaningful  and  should  not be relied  upon as an indication of future  performance.  due to all of the foregoing  factors,  it is possible that the company's  operating results will be below the expectations of market analysts,  if any, and investors.  in such event,  the prevailing  market price,  if any,  of the  common  stock  would  likely  be  materially  adversely affected. see \"risk factors.\" results of operations the company has  incurred  negative  cash flows from  operations  since its inception,  and has  expended  and  expects to continue to expend in the future, substantial  funds  to  complete  its  planned  service   development   efforts, purchasing aircraft and fuel. the company's future capital  requirements and the adequacy  of  available  funds will depend on numerous  factors,  including  the successful  commercialization  of  its  planned  flights,  obtaining  sufficient funding to purchase aircraft and fuel,  hiring  maintenance  personnel,  keeping pace  with  government   regulation,   obtaining   adequate  insurance  and  the development of strategic  alliances  with baggage  handlers,  and airports.  the company believes that its existing capital resources would be sufficient to meet operating  requirements at existing  operating  levels through   december, 1999. however, the company requires the proceeds of this offering and interest thereon to meet its planned operating  requirements  (which will significantly  increase when compared to historical  operating  levels)  through that date. in the event the company's plans change or its  assumptions  change or prove to be inaccurate or the proceeds of the offering prove to be insufficient to fund operations (due to unanticipated expenses,  delays, problems or otherwise), the company could be required to seek  additional  financing  sooner than currently  anticipated.  in addition,  the company will be required to obtain  additional funds in any event through equity or debt financing,  strategic  alliances with corporate  partners and others,  or through  other  sources in order to bring its  services  through regulatory approval to commercialization.  the terms and prices of any equity or debt financing may be significantly  more favorable than those of the units sold in this offering.  the company does not have any material  committed  sources of additional financing,  and there can be no assurance that additional funding, if necessary,  will be available on acceptable  terms, if at all. if adequate funds are not  available,  the  company  may be  required  to  delay,  scale-back,  or eliminate  certain  aspects  of  its  operations.  if  adequate  funds  are  not available,   the  company's  business,   financial  condition,  and  results  of operations will be materially and adversely affected. business history the company was organized as a delaware  corporation  in february  1997. to date, all activities have been  organizational  and developmental in nature. the company  was  formed  to  provide   non-stop  air  service   between   melbourne international  airport and certain key high yield destinations.  initial service is planned between melbourne  international airport and baltimore  international airport,  providing four peak  departures and arrivals from each city daily.  by carefully  selecting  its  markets,  offering  high levels of customer  service, controlling growth, and efficiently using its resources, the company believes it can profitably offer airline services from melbourne, florida. industry conditions and competition the airline industry has experienced  unprecedented growth and profits over the last few years. two basic reasons for this growth and profits are fuel costs and an upturn in the economy.  the cost of fuel greatly affects operating costs. demand for air service increases in a healthy economy. the company's business plan primarily focuses on the business passenger and should not be adversely affected by seasonal leisure travelers. according  to the boeing  company,  air travel  continued to grow at a rate above long-term trend.  airlines  continue to accommodate  robust traffic demand with high load factors.  this trend is  particularly  dramatic in europe and the united  states,  where  airlines have  sustained  load factors at  unprecedented levels. the airlines ability to integrate scheduling, pricing, distribution, and yield management  strategies has allowed them to fill more off-peak seats.  this contributed significantly to the fifth consecutive year of record profits by the worlds  airlines,  particularly  those in europe and the united  states.  in the united states,  airlines again posted record profits in 1997.  this  performance benefited from moderating fuel prices and a two-month lapse of the 10% passenger ticket tax at the start of the year.  air travel  growth is driven  primarily by economic  growth,  and the long-term  economic outlook for the world is healthy. worldwide air travel is projected to average 5% per year over the next",
